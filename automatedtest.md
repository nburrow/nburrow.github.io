#Automated Testing

I created the the automated test using Windows by downloading Node.js and installed the drivers for both Firefox and Chrome. I placed the testing content into file into a notepad and saving the file as google_test.js.  It opened Firefox to the page I designated as twitch.tv, and it closed the browser.
