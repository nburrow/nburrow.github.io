## Fallout 76 Testing

Perk cards causing is causing duplicates, the test that would help determine this would be a white box testing environment by using an automated test.  Automated testing would help, since you would need to check to see if you receive the same perk cards over and over.  The second bug would be there is no timer for players for being AFK, this is a black box testing and playtesting.  The player would be able to inform the developer about this particular feature, so they know if they are about to get kicked for inactivity. For the third bug, there is a crash when sending multiple team invites would crash the xbox to a player that is not a friend.  This is a white box test that is a performance and automated test.  This should have been done in house and an automated test that will send multiple invites to non friends to test the performance of the Xbox or console.  The fourth bug is that subtitles where not appearing correctly for languages that did not have it's own localized voice over.  This is white box testing and localization testing, since it deals with different languages.  The 5th bug is the weapon effects of the Cryolator have been changed.  This is a black box test with balance testing, because you would need to see how the player would use these abilities and correct balancing so that it is not overpowered.
