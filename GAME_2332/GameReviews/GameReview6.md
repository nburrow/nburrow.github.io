# Final Thoughts

For a licensed game based on a movie, this game controls very good, and it is very satisfying when you wall jump perfectly from one area to another without falling or getting hurt.  The game is loosely based on the movie, meaning there are enemies and bosses that are not seen in the movie or in the Batman comics.  However, the bosses are all unique and take a bit of time and skill to complete the level.  This game is very challenging but not so challenging that you get frustrated and want to quit.  The music in the game is fantastic, I could just listen to these songs all day even though it's only 8 bit sound.  I played this game as a kid, and it has aged very well and is still very fun to play.  That said, there is a misspelling in the word parents and is spelled "parrents" in the open scene if you do not press start.  Some of the enemies are a bit hard and some of the jumps are very difficult to pull off without getting hurt.  This is a very solid game for a game that is almost 30 years old.
