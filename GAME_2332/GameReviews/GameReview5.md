* Game Title: Wolfenstein: The New Order

# Summary

Wolfenstein: The New Order was created by Machine Games and published by Bethesda. You play as BJ Blazkowicz and you are put into a coma during World War 2.  You wake up in the 1960 in an alternate timeline where the Nazi's win the war, New York was bombed, and Nazi's have taken over America.  So, you join the few members of the resistance to fight off the Nazi regime.  

# Final Thoughts
I will start by saying I played Wolfenstein 3D when it was new as a kid, and it changed how I viewed video games after.  I honestly didn't play the first 2 Wolfenstein games prior to ID Software getting the rights to make the game, nor did I play the games after except for Enemy Territory.  My expectations were very low, since very older IP are able to translate well into the newer era of gaming.  After playing for a few minutes, I found myself fully engaged in the game and wanting to know what happens next especially after you find out that the Nazi's win the war.  Even though you don't have to play the game in a stealthy manner it, as you can go in guns ablazin'; however, going in unseen is more rewarding as you can get past many sections of the game without firing a single shot.  To say the least, I came in with low expectations, and this game was able to turn this around to make me really like this game.  Machine Games was able to breath life into this old IP, as ID Software did when the revived the IP back in the early 90s.
