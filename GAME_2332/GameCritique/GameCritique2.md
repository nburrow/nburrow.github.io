# Hitman (2016)

Hitman is developed by IO interactive and was published by both Square Enix and WB Interactive For the Playstation 4, Xbox One and Windows. 

Since this is a stealth game, the first thing I tested was the stealth mechanic.  In Hitman, you can put on different disguises to blend in and depending on the disguise will change how certain AI's reacted to you.  In most cases it would work as it should, but in others you could kill someone right as someone was watching and they would not react.  One time in particular, I got caught and I ducked down and the AI said "HE DISAPPEARED" when I was clearly in view.  While at other times, the AI would be hyper sentative to it and would hear you kill someone as you were completely isolated and hidden.  Another thing I tested was the boundries of the levels to see if there was a way to get out of the playable area.  I also looked around at the AI models that were walking around and noticed that they used a lot of the same models over and over again, sometimes you would see the same model 4-5 times right next to each other. This can become distracting and can potentially take you out of your immersion. I also tested the camera functionality and once it managed to get stuck inside the wall and would not move out, causing the screen to be completely green.  The only way that this was fixed was for my player to die and start over.
