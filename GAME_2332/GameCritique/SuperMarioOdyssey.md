## Super Mario Odyssey

Super Mario Odyssey is a 3D platform game that is developed and published by Nintendo, and is released exclusively on the Nintendo Switch on October 27, 2017. In this game, The main featuer is throwing your hat named "Cappy" and you can then possess enemies and control their movements, so this is the first feature I would test by trying to possess each one of the enemies and objects to ensure that you are able to control the enemy as well as use their special ability.  Another famous feature of Mario is his jump, so I would test his jump to make sure that it is fluid and responsive.  Your main goal is to capture Moons to power your "Odyssey" to continue to the next Kingdom. I would test to ensure that the moons are counted when they are collected as well as turned into the Odyssey.  In parts of the game you go down a pipe, and it becomes a 2D platformer game. This would need to be tested in depth, and one thing you would need to test is to ensure your sprite has the same costume as you have on in the 3D mode.
